                    Chandler Bing is a fictional character from the popular TV show "Friends." He is known for his
                    sarcastic sense of humor, quick wit, and awkwardness in social situations. Chandler is often
                    portrayed as the "funny guy" of the group, using humor as a defense mechanism to cope with
                    his insecurities and fears. Despite his sarcastic demeanor, he is also shown to be caring, loyal,
                    and a good friend to his close-knit group of friends.
